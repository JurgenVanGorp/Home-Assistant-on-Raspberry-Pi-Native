# Native Home-Assistant installation on a Raspberry-Pi
Native Home Assistant installation on a Raspberry Pi without using the Docker image.

## ASSUMPTIONS

* You have some experience with Raspberry Pi. Installing Home Assistant with Docker is easier, but you have less control. In this case the control is needed for direct MCP23017 control over I2C.
  * If you prefer doing it the easy way: [the Home Assistant home](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation "The one and only Home Assistant") provides an excellent description of how to do this.
  * A bit more complex instruction [can also be found in Githbu.io] (https://sensorsiot.github.io/IOTstack/Containers/Home-Assistant/)
